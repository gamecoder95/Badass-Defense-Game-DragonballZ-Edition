# Badass-Defense-Game-DragonballZ-Edition

My second game project and my largest personal game project. This is the sequel to my first game project "Badass Defense Game." In this game, the objective is to defend your base from the onslaught of enemies for 25 rounds. You play as Goku, the main character from the DragonBallZ series. You utilize attacks and powers of Goku from the series including shooting energy blasts, beams, Kamehameha wave, and the ability to transform into super saiyan forms (up to Super Saiyan 3). There are also occasional power ups that help you eliminate lare numbers of enemies, heal your base, and give you extra money. Similar to the first game, you purchase abilities and upgrades from the shop after each round using money earned from killing enemies and bonuses.

This project was made in GameMaker 8.1 Lite entirely with GML (Game Maker Language), making this my first ever programming project. Was made in 2013 - 2014.
